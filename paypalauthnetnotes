We just record the payment that PayPal processed on this account. 
PayPal would be the ones connecting the payment to the payment ID 
on their end.

They assign the payment ID and once an approval is sent back to paypal 
then the information gets sent through to us as to weather or not 
that transaction was approved or declined so by then PayPal 
would have assigned that payment to where it should belong.

So, am I correct in assuming, that if i complete the whole paypal 
payment flow on my front end and receive back a payer and payment id, 
meaning card was actually charged, and then i go back to authorize.net 
and submit a paypal transaction with just the payer id as the documentation 
shows, then I have the correct flow?

OK that part is a little above what I know about the process. 
The charge should be already done when the payment is submitted 
through paypal. You should not be having to go back to this 
account to submit anything.

You will just see the already completed transaction. Not sure if that 
answers what you just asked.

PayPal still processes the charge request and then sends the information
 to us with the approval or decline information once that is done.
